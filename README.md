# Sentiment-Analysis
This project gives you a point system on your emotions in a sentence. 
For example:
if I say "I am happy"; I will get a score of 3 saying I am happy.
if I write:
"I am sad", I will get a score of -2 meaning that my I am sad.

If the score is in the negatives, you are sad or your not feeling good but if you are in the positives, you are in a good mood/happy.
